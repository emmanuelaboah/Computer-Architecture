# Microcontroller Design and Programming
This repository contains projects related to C programming and hardware interfacing of the 
PIC24 microcontroller. 
Some of the interfacing examples include LEDs, and pushbutton switches etc, using serial peripheral bus (SPI),
timers, inter-integrated circuit bus (I2C) etc.

## Notice!
The projects in this repository make use of <i class="icon-cog"></i> **[MPLAB](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide#tabs)** IDE for the programming and debugging of the Microchip PIC24 microcontroller.
