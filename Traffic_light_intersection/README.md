## Objective of Project

The objective of this project is to:

**Provide the details of the implementation of a traffic light at the intersection of one main street and one small street.**

The idea was to implement a traffic light controller for an intersection with twelve lights which comprise of a two-lane expressway as the main street and a two-lane road as the minor. 

Traffic movement on the main road at the intersection has a longer time and the traffic halt period has a shorter delay time as compared with the minor road. The various states considered in the implementation of this project are analyzed below.
