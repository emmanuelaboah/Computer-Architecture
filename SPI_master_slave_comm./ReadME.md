## Project Overview 
In this project, two Microstick boards were connected together as master-slave using SPI communication.  
The first PCI board(master) sends a byte to the slave PIC. The slave PCI then changes a sequence of LEDs according to the recieved byte from the master.  
The connection parallel connection between the two Microstick PIC board is shown below:
